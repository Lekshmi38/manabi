## Manabi is a platform where learning is fun.
The Comic Generator project is an educational web app that helps users learn a wide range of subjects through mnemonic storytelling and visual comics. Users input a topic or concept, and the app generates a mnemonic story using AI to simplify complex information into easy-to-remember narratives. It then creates illustrations based on the story, turning the mnemonics into engaging comics.Targeted at students and neurodivergent learners, the project enhances accessibility and retention by combining storytelling and visual aids, making learning more interactive and enjoyable across various subjects.
